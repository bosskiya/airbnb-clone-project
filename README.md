# 🔐 API Security

    Ensuring the security of our API is a top priority. The following practices are implemented to protect data and maintain secure access:
    🔑 Authentication
        JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for authenticating users.
        Tokens are required for accessing protected routes.
        Tokens have expiration times to enhance session security.
    
    🔒 Authorization
        Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users only access permitted resources.
        Admin, property owner, and general user roles are enforced at the API level.
    
    🧼 Input Validation & Sanitization
        All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
        Strong schema validation using libraries like Joi, Zod, or built-in frameworks.
    
    📦 HTTPS & Secure Headers
        All traffic is served over HTTPS.
        Security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options) are configured to protect against common attacks.
    
    🛡 Rate Limiting & Throttling
        Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks.
        IP throttling and account-based limitations are enforced.
    
    🧯 Error Handling & Logging
        Sensitive information is never exposed in error messages.
        Secure logging practices are in place to monitor and detect suspicious activity.

# 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

    Our CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application to ensure high code quality and faster delivery.
    🚀 Continuous Integration (CI)
        Automated Builds: Every push or pull request triggers a build process.
        Linting & Formatting: Code is checked against style guides automatically.
        Unit & Integration Tests: Test suites are executed to validate new changes.
        Static Code Analysis: Tools like ESLint, Prettier, or SonarQube ensure code consistency and detect vulnerabilities.
    
    🔄 Continuous Deployment (CD)
        Staging Deployment: Code is automatically deployed to a staging environment for QA and testing.
        Production Deployment: Upon successful review and approval, changes are deployed to the production environment.
        Rollback Support: Deployment history and versioning allow for safe rollbacks if needed.
    
    🔐 Security & Secrets Management
        Environment variables and secrets are managed securely using tools like GitHub Actions Secrets, Vault, or AWS Secrets Manager.
        Sensitive data is never hard-coded or exposed in the pipeline.
